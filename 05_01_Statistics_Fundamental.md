# Statistics Fundamentals

## The 8-20% you should know about Statistics.


#### Histograms

A histogram is a type of graph used to represent the distribution of a set of data

### Probability Distributions

The histogram and the curve are "distributions". They show us how the probabiliteis of measurements are distributed

#### Mean, median, mode, normal distribution, standard deviation

`Mean`: The average value of a dataset, calculated by adding up all the numbers an dividing by the count of numbers.  
`Median`: Middle value in a dataset.  
`Mode`: The most requently occurring value in a dataset.  
`Normal distribution`:A probability distribution that ia symmetric around the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.  
`standard deviation`: How wide the curve is around the mean.  

#### Population and Estimated Parameters.

Since we rarely, if ever have enough time and money to measure every single thing in a population we almost always estimate the **population parameters** using a relatively small sample.  
The more data that we have, the more confidence we can have in the accuracy of the estimates.

One of the main goals in statistics is quantifying how muchs confidence we can hae in pupulation estimates 
so we calculated **p-values** and **confidence intervals** to quantify the confidence in the estimates parameters.
