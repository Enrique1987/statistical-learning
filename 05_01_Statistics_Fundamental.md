`Mean`: The average value of a dataset, calculated by adding up all the numbers an dividing by the count of numbers.  
`Median`: Middle value in a dataset.  
`Mode`: The most requently occurring value in a dataset.  
`Normal distribution`:A probability distribution that ia symmetric around the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.
