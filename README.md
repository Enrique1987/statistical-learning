## Statistical concepts - Interview Questions

### in your own words, what do the p-values indicate ? 
It tells us how statistically significant a hypothesis is agains observer data. The lower the **p-values** the better. the limit to be considered significant is **p < 0.05**.  

   - p > 0.1 --> No evidence agains the null hypothesis.  
   - 0.01 < p < 0.05 --> Moderate evidence agains the null hypothesis.  
   p < 0.001 Very strong evidence agains the null hypothesis.  

**Null Hypothesis** = Two possibilities are the same.


### What is Conditional Probabilities ?

Simply the probability that something will happend, scaled by whatever knowledge we alread have about the event.
